# Semantic UI Component for VueJS

![Build](https://travis-ci.org/HandOfGod94/vue-semantic.svg?branch=master)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/HandOfGod94/vue-semantic/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/HandOfGod94/vue-semantic?branch=master)

> Work In Progress

The main aim of this project is not just limited to creating wrapper
around Semantic UI components but to create a framework that can
handle data intensive tasks, such as:
* Searching
* Sorting
* Grouping
* (Advance) Graph and Data plot
* (Advnace) Querying mechanism to extract data from rendernderd componets.s

Documentation still requires a lot of work.
More UT's and Components coming soon.
